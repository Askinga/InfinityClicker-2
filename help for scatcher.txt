hello, this is to help if you use scratch

firstly is Decimal (i made this one) is just for bigger numbers upto 1e1.79E308 (10^1.79e308) rather than 1.79e308 (Infinity)

Decimal.add(left, right); add(8,5) , returns 13 as a Decimal;
Decimal.sub(left, right); sub(8,5) , returns 3 as a Decimal;

Decimal.mul(left, right); mul(100,10) , returns 1000 as a Decimal;
Decimal.div(left, right); div(100,10) , returns 10 as a Decimal;

Decimal.pow(left, right); pow(10,2) , returns 100 as a Decimal;
Decimal.log(left, right); log(100,10) , returns 2 as a Decimal;  the second imput has to be a number

Decimal.root(left, right); root(100,2) , returns 10 as a Decimal; the second imput has to be a number

Decimal.toString(length); (1000).toString(5) , returns "`1000.00000" as a string, imput must be a number

max returns heighest value
min returns lowest value

Math.clamp - change the value to be between the min and max; Math.clamp(20,5,10) return 10; Math.clamp(2,8,28) return 8; Math.clamp(20,8,28) return 20;
Math.randomBetween - returns a value between the inputs; Math.randomBetween(12, 25) returns a number 12 to 25;

2:

adding upgrades

copy the code for one of the upgrades and change the values

for a new layer of upgrades copy the file and change names, add foreach to startup making 

3:
arrays are like list but the first is 0 not 1 so it's like this array[0] in scratch its [1] for its first

4: adding new layer

add it to the HTML and give upgrades that id

look for "htanl" or the layer-upgrades.js files on where to add new content
